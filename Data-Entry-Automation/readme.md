# Data Entry Automation for New York Rentals.

This project aims to automate the data entry process for rental listings in New York using web scraping techniques and the Zillow website. The goal is to save time and increase efficiency in the data entry process.

## Features:
1. Extract rental listing data from Zillow website using web scraping techniques
2. Create a Google sheet using the extracted data
3. Ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data entered

## Constraints:
1. The project is limited to the data available on the Zillow website and may not include all rental listings in New York.
2. The project does not involve any analysis or modeling of the data.
3. The project does not include validation or verification of the data entered into the Google sheet.


## Future work:
1. Integrating the Google sheet with other tools or platforms
2. Expanding the data sources beyond Zillow
3. Improving the accuracy and completeness of the data entered
