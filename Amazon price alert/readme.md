# Amazon Price Alert Automation using Beautiful Soup

This project allows users to monitor the price of a specific item on Amazon and receive email alerts when the price drops below a certain threshold. It utilizes web scraping techniques with the Beautiful Soup package to extract the item's current price from the Amazon website and sends email notifications using the SMTP(Simple mail transfer protocol).
