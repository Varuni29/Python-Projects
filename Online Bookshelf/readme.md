# About the Project
I have developed an online bookshelf application using Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and HTML. This application allows users to manage and organize their book collection virtually. Leveraging Flask for the backend and SQLAlchemy for database management, the application provides functionalities such as adding new books, updating book details, and deleting books from the collection. The HTML templates ensure a user-friendly interface for browsing and interacting with the bookshelf. While the current implementation is a codebase, it serves as a foundation for creating an actual webpage for users to access and utilize the online bookshelf.
